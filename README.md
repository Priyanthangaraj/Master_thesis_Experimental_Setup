# Multi-Radar mmWave Experimental Setup & Dataset  
This repository contains the code, configuration files, and experimental dataset used to evaluate multi-radar calibration and fusion using TI AWR1843 mmWave sensors.  
The system uses **three spatially separated radars**, each interfaced with a Raspberry Pi 4 running **Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic**, and captures single-drone, multi-drone, and human-motion scenarios under various indoor and outdoor environments.
