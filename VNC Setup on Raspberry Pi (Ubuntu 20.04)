This guide describes how to install and configure TigerVNC on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 20.04, with remote access via SSH tunneling (PuTTY) and a VNC viewer.

Important: Ensure no VPN is active on your laptop during the setup.
Reference: UMich VNC Tunnel Guide

1. Prepare the Raspberry Pi
  Flash Ubuntu 20.04 onto the SD card.
  Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi.
  Connect a keyboard, mouse, and display.
  Boot and log in to Ubuntu.


2. Update System Packages
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


3. Install XFCE Desktop Environment
    sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y
    sudo reboot
  This enables a lightweight GUI suitable for VNC access.


4. Configure Wi-Fi (Mobile Hotspot)
  Edit the netplan file:
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
  Enter your hotspot’s SSID and password, save, then apply:
    sudo netplan apply
  Your Raspberry Pi should now connect to your phone/laptop hotspot.

5. Optional: Install Firefox Browser
  sudo apt install firefox -y

6. Install TigerVNC Server
    sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-common -y
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies xfce4-terminal -y
  When prompted, select lightdm as the display manager.

7. Configure VNC Startup Script
  Edit the VNC startup file:
    nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
  Paste the following:
    #!/bin/bash
    unset SESSION_MANAGER
    unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
    startxfce4 &
  Make it executable:
    chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup


8. Enable SSH Password Authentication
  Edit:
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  Set:
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
  Restart SSH:
    sudo systemctl restart ssh


9. Find the Raspberry Pi IP Address
  Connect your laptop and the Raspberry Pi to the same hotspot.
  On Windows, open Command Prompt:
    ipconfig
  Find your laptop's IP address.
  List devices on the network:
    arp -a
  Look for an entry similar to:
    b8:27:eb:xx:xx:xx
    dc:a6:32:xx:xx:xx
  These correspond to Raspberry Pi MAC prefixes → this is your Pi’s IP address.

10. Configure PuTTY SSH Tunnel for VNC
    Open PuTTY → enter Pi's IP address → select SSH.
    Navigate to:
      Connection → SSH → Tunnels
    Add the tunnel:
      Source port: 5901
      Destination: localhost:5901
    Click Add, save the session, then Open.
    Enter Pi username and password.


11. Start VNC Server on Raspberry Pi
    Set the VNC password:
      vncpasswd
    Start the server:
      vncserver
    This creates display :1 (port 5901).

12. Connect Using VNC Viewer
    Open VNC Viewer and connect to:
      localhost:1
    Enter the VNC password you set (e.g., 123456).
    You now have full remote desktop access to your Raspberry Pi.
