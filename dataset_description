## 📡 System Overview
Each radar node includes:

- TI **AWR1843** FMCW mmWave radar  
- Raspberry Pi 4 running **Ubuntu 20.04**  
- Custom **mmWave .cfg** for high-resolution 4 GHz bandwidth  
- ROS package `ti_mmwave_rospkg` for real-time point cloud streaming  
- Remote access via SSH + VNC  
- Synchronized experiment execution for all 3 radars

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
Detailed setup instructions are available in:

- `AWR1843_Radar_Installation_Guide/`
- `VNC_Setup_on_Raspberry_Pi/`

These guides include:

- Flashing Ubuntu 20.04  
- Installing ROS Noetic (minimal setup)  
- Configuring UART communication  
- Launching radar nodes  
- Recording ROS bag files  
- Converting `.bag → .txt` format

- Naming convention  
- Sensor orientation (yaw 0°, ±10°, +20°)  
- Indoor vs. outdoor scenes  
- Drone/human trajectories  
- Contents of `.txt` files  
- Radar identifiers (O, L, R)

Experimental Scenarios Included
The dataset contains:

- Single-drone trajectories
  - Circular  
  - Diamond / rhombus  
  - Straight-line motion  

- Multi-drone scenarios  
  - Two drones flying simultaneously  
  - Overlapping trajectories  
  - Varying distances & angles  

- Human motion experiments
  - Single person walking  
  - Two persons crossing paths  
  - Mixed drone + human scenes  

- Calibration recordings
  - Static reflectors  
  - Yaw variations: `0°`, `10° inward`, `10° outward`, `20° inward`


Dataset Download
The dataset is provided as `.zip` archives inside the `datasets/` folder, organized by:

- Environment  
- Radar yaw configuration  
- Motion type (drone/human)  

Upload your `.zip` files to GitHub or a cloud service.  
Then update the links below:


Each file includes:
  x, y, z, range, doppler, doppler_bin, angle, SNR, noise, timestamp


These logs can be used for:
  - Multi-radar calibration  
  - Data fusion  
  - Target tracking  
  - Clutter analysis  
  - Cross-sensor alignment  

  
Reproducing Experiments
  1. Load the provided `.cfg` file into each radar using ROS.  
  2. Arrange the radars in a straight line with ~0.65 m spacing.  
  3. Select trajectory script (drone/human).  
  4. Record point clouds using `rosbag`.  
  5. Convert bags to text format.
