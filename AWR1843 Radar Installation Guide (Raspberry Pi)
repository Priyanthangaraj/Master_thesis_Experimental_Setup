Raspberry Pi mmWave Radar Setup Guide (Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic + AWR1843)

This guide describes the complete workflow for preparing a Raspberry Pi, installing Ubuntu 20.04, configuring ROS Noetic, adding the TI AWR1843 radar ROS package, and recording radar data.

Step 1 — Flash Ubuntu 20.04 to the SD Card
        Download Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows.
        Insert the SD card using a card reader and format if necessary.
        Open the Imager and select:
        Device: Raspberry Pi 4 / 5
        OS: Ubuntu 20.04 (General-purpose)
        Storage: Your SD card
        In the configuration menu, enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password (recommended for hotspot use).
        Flash the image to the SD card.


Step 2 — Boot the Raspberry Pi
        Insert the SD card into the Pi and connect keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
        Power on the device and log in with the default or user-defined credentials.


Step 3 — Configure Wi-Fi (Hotspot Mode)
        Create a hotspot on your laptop/mobile using the same SSID and password configured during flashing.
        On the Pi, edit the netplan config: 
          sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
        Add/update the Wi-Fi password under the defined network (Fig. 1 if referenced in documentation).
        Apply the changes:
          sudo netplan apply


Step 4 — Install Desktop Environment
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade -y       # reboot if necessary
        sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop -y
        sudo reboot
      This provides a full GUI environment for easier debugging.


Step 5 — Install ROS Noetic (ROS-Base)
        Follow the official ROS Noetic installation guide.
        Complete sections 1.2 and 1.3 (sources & keys).
        In 1.4, install ros-noetic-ros-base.
        If package errors occur:
          sudo apt update
        Perform all steps in 1.5, except the optional zsh setup.
        Complete 1.6 to initialize ROS environment variables.

Step 6 — Create a Catkin Workspace
        Follow ROS official instructions (LINK):
          mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
          cd ~/catkin_ws
          catkin_make


Step 7 — Add Radar ROS Package
        Download the radar package ZIP (provided in repository/releases).
        Extract it and copy the contents of src/ into:
          ~/catkin_ws/src/
        Build the workspace:
          cd ~/catkin_ws
          catkin_make


Step 8 — Resolve Common Build Errors
        C/C++ compiler issues
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install g++
        PCL-related errors
          sudo apt install libpcl-dev
          sudo apt install ros-noetic-pcl-ros
        Additionally, update CMakeLists.txt:
        At the top of the file inside ti_mmwave_rospkg folder, add:
          set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
        Rebuild:
          cd ~/catkin_ws
          catkin_make


Step 9 — Enable rosbag Recording in Launch File
        Open:
          catkin_ws/src/ti_mmwave_rospkg/launch/awr1843boost_test.launch
        Add the following node (ensure a space before /ti_mmwave):
          <!-- Enable rosbag recording -->
          <node name="bag_record" pkg="rosbag" type="record"
                args="record -O /home/rootname /ti_mmwave/radar_scan" />


Step 10 — Launch the Radar Node
          Before launching, ensure system time is synced (connect to Wi-Fi).
          Connect and power the radar module.
          Navigate to the launch directory:
            cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ti_mmwave_rospkg/launch/
          Launch:
            roslaunch awr1843boost_test.launch
          If an error occurs, close the terminal and repeat the launch.
          Radar data is now being recorded into a .bag file.


Step 11 — Convert .bag to .txt
          Use the provided Python script:
            python3 /home/ACPS/Documents/code.py \
                    /home/ACPS/Documents/filename.bag \
                    filename.txt \
                    /ti_mmwave/radar_scan
          Where:
          filename.bag = recorded radar data
          filename.txt = user-defined output file


User Credentials (Example Setup)
          | Radar Position | Username | Password |
          | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
          | Middle Radar   | ACPS     | 1234     |
          | Right Radar    | rpi1     | 1234     |
          | Left Radar     | rpi2     | 1234     |
